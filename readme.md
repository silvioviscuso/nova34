## Overview
This is an open-source headboard custom PCB designed in Altium for integration with the NXP MIMX8MN5DVPIZAA (I.MX 8M NANO - ULTRALIGHT 11x1MM 8nm). The board is designed to support essential peripherals such as eMMC storage, LPDDR4X RAM, WiFi/Bluetooth, camera module, and display. The design is optimized for performance and ease of assembly, with a compact form factor.

üéØ **The goal was to make it accessible to everyone‚Äîhobbyists, makers, robotics enthusiasts‚Äîwithout minimum order limitations.** This project follows the workflow of creating an SBC (Single Board Computer), robot board, and wearable device.

## üîß Design and PCB Progress  
#### Revision Notes

In **Rev_1.0 to Rev_1.3**, the process included several testing phases to assess the engineering validity of component research and selection.  

During this phase, we identified the **ADP191ACBZ-R7**, an ultra-compact high-side load switch. This component could be useful for managing power distribution efficiently, providing controlled power switching to different subsystems while offering short-circuit and overcurrent protection. However, based on the latest schematic, the **PMIC should already handle all power management efficiently, safely, and in a controlled manner**, making additional power switching unnecessary in most scenarios.  

Additionally, we replaced the **RTL8723DS (6x6mm)** combo-chip Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. Its footprint fit comfortably in the upper-right section of the back-side of the board. However, after further evaluation, we found a better and more compact alternative: the **CYW43012**, which offers improved efficiency and performance.  

Initially, we also considered the **AMA3B1KK-KBR-B0 (Apollo3 Blue)**, but in the end, we opted for the **CYW43012** as the best choice for this design. That said, we could still explore **future variants** incorporating different wireless solutions based on project needs.  

Placement and optimization trials were conducted, along with numerous other evaluations, successfully achieving the set objectives.  

Now, with the **final revision**, the **schematic is fully defined and accurate**, allowing for a more streamlined approach to PCB design in **High-Speed Design & Signal Integrity**.
