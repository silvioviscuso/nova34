# NOVA34 Ultra Small Linux Board - Custom PCB Open Source üöÄ

![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/your-repo.svg?style=flat&logo=github) 

## Overview
This is an open-source headboard custom PCB designed in Altium for integration with the NXP MIMX8MN5DVPIZAA (I.MX 8M NANO). The board is designed to support essential peripherals such as eMMC storage, LPDDR4X RAM, WiFi/Bluetooth, camera module, and display. The design is optimized for performance and ease of assembly, with a compact form factor.

üéØ **The goal was to make it accessible to everyone‚Äîhobbyists, makers, robotics enthusiasts‚Äîwithout minimum order limitations.** This project follows the workflow of creating an SBC (Single Board Computer), robot board, and wearable device.
